This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

This project offers a variety of features to enhance the usability and functionality of a web application. Here are some of the key features included:

- **Responsive Navigation**: Includes a fully responsive navigation system with mobile and desktop support. The navigation system intelligently hides and shows navigation options based on the user's device type.

- **Context API**: Leverages React's Context API to manage global state across the application, allowing components to access and manipulate global state without prop drilling.


- **Error Handling**: Implements a user-friendly error handling system that guides users back to the homepage if they navigate to a non-existent route within the application.

- **Animation and Transitions**: Uses Framer Motion to provide smooth and animations and transitions for modal dialogs and other UI elements.

- **Accessibility Features**: Ensures accessibility standards are met
  
- **Customizable Components**: Offers a range of customizable components like buttons and fonts, designed to be reused throughout the application to maintain a consistent look and feel.
