This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About This Project

### Introduction
The Majority tourism information application is a comprehensive digital tool designed to assist tourists in planning their travels effectively. This application provides detailed, up-to-date information about destinations worldwide, helping users make informed decisions about where to go, what to see, and how to prepare.

### Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to simplify the process of travel planning by providing reliable, accessible information in one centralized location. 


## Development Journey of the Majority Travel Information Application

### Conceptualization Phase

The project commenced with the goal of developing a mock travel information website that would leverage the branding and design ethos of Majority. The first step involved identifying the information to be displayed from the API

### Design Implementation

#### Utilizing Figma

With the idea in place, the next step involved translating these concepts into a tangible design. To accomplish this, I utilized Figma. The design process was guided by Majority's existing brand assets, including themes and colors, to ensure consistency and brand alignment. I had a design system within Figma to maintain uniformity across different parts of the application.

### Functional Development

#### Understanding Core Functionalities

Before diving into coding, I dedicated time to fully understand the primary functions required for the application. This included how to effectively fetch data from the chosen APIs and render this data dynamically on the web pages. 

### Implementation Stage

#### Coding the Application

With a design in Figma and a basic understanding of the necessary functionalities, I began the coding phase. This part of the journey involved translating the Figma designs into code, using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and React. During this stage, I continuously referred back to the design prototypes to ensure accuracy in the user interface. I integrated the APIs to fetch the required data and implemented React state management to handle the dynamic aspects of the application.


## Features
This project offers a variety of features to enhance the usability and functionality of a web application. Here are some of the key features included:

- **Responsive Navigation**: Includes a fully responsive navigation system with mobile and desktop support. The navigation system intelligently hides and shows navigation options based on the user's device type.

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Utilizes React's powerful state management to dynamically render content based on the user's interactions. This includes displaying different information based on the selected country or region.

- **Context API**: Leverages React's Context API to manage global state across the application, allowing components to access and manipulate global state without prop drilling.


- **Error Handling**: Implements a user-friendly error handling system that guides users back to the homepage if they navigate to a non-existent route within the application.

- **Animation and Transitions**: Uses Framer Motion to provide smooth and animations and transitions for modal dialogs and other UI elements.

- **Accessibility Features**: Ensures accessibility standards are met
  
- **Customizable Components**: Offers a range of customizable components like buttons and fonts, designed to be reused throughout the application to maintain a consistent look and feel.

## If I Had More Time

With additional time to further develop this project, there are several enhancements and new features I would have tried to implement. These improvements aim to expand the functionality, improve user experience, and increase the scalability of the application. Here are some of the key areas I would focus on:

- **Integrate chat-gpt API**: By pre-prompt engineering, have chat-gpt create personalized information about each country searched.

- **More CSS**: Make many CSS adjustments to make the project look more professional.

- **Unit and Integration Testing**: Implement unit tests to ensure each component functions correctly in isolation and within the application ecosystem. This would improve the reliability and maintainability of the code.

- **Advanced Error Handling**: Develop a more robust error handling system that can manage and respond to unexpected behaviors or errors more gracefully. This would include user-friendly error messages and fallback options that enhance the overall user experience.

- **Performance Optimization**: Focus on optimizing the application's performance, particularly in data handling and rendering processes. The project scores high up google Lighthouse for SEO, Accessibility, Best Practices etc but needs to do better in terms of performance

- **Better Accessibility Features**: While the project is accessible, I would invest time in conducting thorough accessibility audits and making necessary adjustments to better adhere to WCAG guidelines.

- **API Integration**: Expand the applicationâ€™s capabilities by integrating additional APIs. My original wish was to incorporate a chat gpt API and have tailored results on each country search.

- **Animations**: There are many more concepts of animation and framer motion that I would have tried to implement.

Each of these enhancements would help to refine the project and extend its scope to better meet the needs of its users while adhering to industry best practices.
